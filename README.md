# webapi_ML_Model
create a ML model Web API
First, we create a folder for this project called Spam-Detector or any Folder , this is the directory tree inside the folder:

"""spam.csv
app.py
templates/
        home.html
        result.html
static/
        style.css
        
 """
 
 Once you have done all of the above, you can start running the API by either double click appy.py , 
 or executing the command from the Terminal:
 
"""
cd Spam-Detector
python app.py
"""

Now you could open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, 
we should see a simple website with the content
